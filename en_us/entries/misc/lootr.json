So don't mine those chests you find in the world, leave them so every other player on the server can get their loot from it as well.  Sharing is caring."

We'll leave the color code up to you to find out, as I have the utmost of confidence (only on weekends) that you will be able to deduce it in no time!  But what if you forget and start to break it?  Lootr will gently remind you that other players can still get loot from this chest, and it's not cool to break it."
