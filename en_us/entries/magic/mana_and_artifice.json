Then comes the hard part, finding a Spellmonger Villager to make a Runeforge.  But don't despaif if you can't find one, there's ways to craft them; check your Codex Arcana!"

Cast more fire spells for example, you will become better at fire but worse at water.  The Codex Arcana has a tremendous guide on how to level your skills and knowledge into higher tier spells, but the process is not for the faint of heart.  This is because several of the high-tier spells and artifacts are locked to a certain faction, and once you join a faction there is no going back!"
