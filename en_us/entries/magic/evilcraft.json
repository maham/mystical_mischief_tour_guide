Slay mobs with it in your inventory to gain blood. Use some of the blood in the world and wait for it to solidify. Break it with a flint and steel. Use these as crafting ingrediants and fuel for a Blood Infuser and other tools and ingredients but be sure to make a Vengeance Pickaxe to get the Crushed Dark Gems you'll need!"

You can infuse certain things to make them stronger, and even use blood to repair items.  It also adds in a variety of monster spawns that are guaranteed to make your life easier, but don't despair.  Because you can transform biomes as you please now."
