When it experiences a greusome demise an anomaly will appear, throw a normal book in quickly and you will have the guide book in your possession now!"

You can infuse certain things to make them stronger, and even use blood to repair items.  It also adds in a variety of monster spawns that are guaranteed to make your life easier, but don't despair.  Because you can transform biomes as you please now."
