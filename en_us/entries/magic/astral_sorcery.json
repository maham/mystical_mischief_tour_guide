Large scale rituals where you can smite your enemies, make crops grow quicker, and even turn stone into ore deposits.  If you are having a hard time with monsters, you can also make upgraded weapons and attune a cloak to receive additional bonuses. You might even find a rare liquid starlight reservior!"
